Java Front for XT (version 0.1.7)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

	* Java Front now comes with a grammar for Generic-Java.
    Although Generic-Java is a language shared by many proposals for parameterized
    types, this grammar is designed to be compatible with 
    JSR-14: "Adding Generics to the Java Programming Language". Of course there is
    also a Stratego-Generic-Java grammar. The pretty-printer has been extended to handle
    generics.

	* The grammar for mixing Stratego and Java has been improved after some
    code generation experiments. Future versions of Java Front might include
    some strategies for code-generation in Stratego.

	* Java Front now comes with a hand-crafted pretty printer
    This pretty-printer has been written in Stratego with concrete syntax for the box language
    of Merijn de Jonge.
