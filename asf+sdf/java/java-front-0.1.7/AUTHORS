All tests that start with a T followed by an integer
identifier are taken from the Jacks project, which
offers a huge test-suite for Java compilers.

Jacks includes a collection of Java compiler tests
contributed by people on the net. Jacks is free software
licensed under the terms of the GPL.
A test case must be licensed under the terms
of the GPL to be suitable for inclusion into Jacks,
but authors retain the original copyright.

Java Front for XT is distributed with a grammar for the 
BOX language. This grammar has been written by:
