%% We applied several modifications to this original BOX language. On the
%% one hand these modifications include a redesign of the SDF definition of
%% the BOX language. On the other hand, we adapted the BOX language itself
%% (we removed several BOX operators and introduced several new ones). For
%% more information on the BOX language we refer to the following technical
%% reports:
