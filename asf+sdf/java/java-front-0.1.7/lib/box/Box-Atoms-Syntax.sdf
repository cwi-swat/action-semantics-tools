%% \noindent
%% The most elementary boxes are strings enclosed in double quotes
%% (literals) and numbered placeholders. Numbered placeholders refer to a
%% sub-expression of a BOX term. Currently, referencing sub-terms at a
%% maximum level of two is supported. For example, \_i.j refers to the jth
%% element within the ith BOX of a BOX term.
