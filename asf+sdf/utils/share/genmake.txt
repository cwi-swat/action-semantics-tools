Problems:
- implodePT must be standardized
- sdf.cons.pp does not take renamings and parameterization properly
  this is perhaps a problem with sdf2.1 (should be sdf2.4).
- concatasf dumps core
- A(r,c,l) etc. do not work properly (?)
- large latex files: is this only a consequence of problems
  with IndexedTrace.asf etc.? Concatenation of ps files is
  not satisfactory.
- lex-con-<name> attributes are not satisfactory.
- we want separate pp tables for terms over a language (not eqs).
- ASF.pp.working is used (this is without tables)
  nesting depth for indexed trace, context-info, mutableinfo asf
  leads to a capacity problem in TeX (why???)
- addeqssyntax.new add syntax that is too allowing
  a = b c = d, d = f ===== f(a) = c is allowed. That is
  commas have become optional

Cleaning up:
- use autoconf to get prefixes right.
- make a proper script of genmake.py (usage etc.)
- contact cwi about imploders and sdf.cons.pp
- in the meantime, restructure genmake.py
- use more variables and possibly "include" primitive
- separate default.abbrevs into the original default abbrevs 
  and asf.abbrevs
- include sdf-extra.pp in sdf.cons.pp to SDF.pp
- bundle this with ASF.pp in the package
- as well as SDF.abbrevs ASF.abbrevs
- standardize use of tools (mix xt and meta as little as possible.
- standarize upon extensions and generations of pdf/ps
- ensure that pdf/dvi are produced in the right directory
- use a tool other than sdf-imports to speed up generation
- document the various pipelines!!!
- make the web target work: how to use tohtml-sdf
- Currently sdf-imports only has path . at its disposal,
  it should search for asf-library and meta.conf paths. But
  all pp files, cons attributes, def, and abbrevs should be available
  in those trees. But asf-library is likely not to be writeable...
  Best practice now: cp the entire tree to .

Desired dist:
- gen-meta-make (gen-meta-make.py)
- concat-abbrevs (concat-abbrevs.c)
- ASF.pp ASF.abbrevs SDF.pp SDF.abbrevs
- addconseqssyntax (remake of addeqssyntax)

Current configuration:
- Implode Implode.trm.tbl implode-rest.sh:
  Use to implode the bits that implodePT and implode-asfix
  can't handle. Should be made useless.
- genmake.py M, produces a for module M
- sdf-extra.pp: pp rules for non sdf.cons.pp features
- compose-abbrevs[.c] composes abbreviation files for abox2latex.
- addeqssyntax.new: adds eqs syntax with cons attributes
